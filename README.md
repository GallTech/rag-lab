## Homelab Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to ingest, embed, and query ~100,000 Artificial Intelligence research papers.

## Project Goals
1.	Hands-on learning: Build my first non-trivial Linux software project, gaining practical experience with Python, Bash, GitHub, monitoring, and related tooling.
2.	Deep dive into RAG & AI: Explore the architecture, components, and best practices of retrieval-augmented generation systems.
3.	User Experience & Prompt Engineering: Design intuitive interfaces and effective, measurable prompts. 
4.	Practical research assistant: Maintain a weekly-updated repository of the latest AI research, enriched through my RAG pipeline and queried via LLMs.

The lab ingests ~100,000 AI research papers from **SharePoint**, **OpenAlex**, and other sources. It extracts metadata and ACLs, and generates vector embeddings for retrieval-augmented LLM reasoning. Each week I will add the latest available papers.
